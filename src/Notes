What we will need
-Data structures
-Class info, schedules etc
-interface (such as a gui or something like that0
-students, professor admin
this is going to be a better version of "my info"
for instance, maybe something like "what are the required classes for 'core'"
same group all semester
draw.io google umo things
visio will be used in the class
no late submissions unless medical emergency
it's okay to upload code to stack overflow just no copying prewritten code from places, results are an auto F
group projects are 50% of our grade
2 exams 30%
final - 2 hours, cumulative, 20% of our grade
